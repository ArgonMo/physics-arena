 For many physical problems, a clean solution cannot be provided as an analytical solution. To reach the answer of these cases or problems whose analytical solution is complicated, numerical solution can be replaced.
 In this project, a number of basic mathematical tools such as numerical integral have been prepared in different ways. In addition to these, there are relatively modern and complex physical modeling such as the Ising model in this project.
 I try to add more parts to this project whenever I can.
